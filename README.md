This is the Accenture NAVIGATING NUMBERS, Bring data to life with analytics &amp; visualization programs. 

Thank you to Accenture for providing the invaluable opportunity to participate in their 'Accenture North America' virtual internship program through Forage!

Throughout this journey, I have honed the following skills:

Project Understanding: Quickly grasping the business problem at hand, aligning with team objectives, and efficiently setting project priorities.
Data Cleaning & Modeling: I have gained a deep understanding of data and have refined my skills in data modeling to extract crucial insights.
Data Visualization & Storytelling: Through data analysis, I've learned to visualize data effectively, narrate compelling stories, and uncover significant business insights.
Client Presentations: The program enabled me to confidently present my findings and insights back to the client, bolstering my skills in communication and public speaking.
I am now more assured of my ability to initiate and manage projects, interact proficiently with clients, and offer impactful advice and solutions that will contribute positively to projects and the wider organization.
